# IML-coursework

This repository contains the codes for the projects that I have completed as part of my professional elective course on **Introduction to Machine Learning (IML)** offered by my college.

The projects cover various topics and techniques in machine learning, from the basics of data preprocessing, linear regression, and classification, to the advanced topics of neural networks, deep learning, and computer vision.

The projects are implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.

Each project folder contains a Jupyter notebook with the code and a report with the results and analysis.
